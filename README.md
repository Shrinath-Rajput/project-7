Billing Software
This project is a Billing Software System built using Python (Tkinter for GUI) and MySQL for backend database storage. It allows users to enter customer details (name and phone number), input product information (name, rate, quantity), and dynamically generate a printable bill showing all purchased items with their quantities and prices. The software calculates the total payable amount and displays it in a bill format. All transaction data can be saved into a MySQL database for future reference and record-keeping. The interface is user-friendly and ideal for small retail shops or businesses looking to automate their billing process. Key features include adding items to the bill, clearing inputs, exiting the application, and generating a formatted bill display area that summarizes the purchase. This project demonstrates GUI development with Tkinter, real-time calculations, and database integration in a practical, business-oriented Python application.
